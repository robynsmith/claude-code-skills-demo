## Process

1. **Understand the Input**

2. **Read Current Journal**
   - Open `contexts/personal/2_areas/journal.md`
   - Understand the existing format and style
   - Find the correct location for today's entry

3. **Format the Entry**
   - Add today's date as a heading if not already present (### Month Day, Year)
   - Create a bold topic header that captures the essence
   - Preserve the authentic, conversational tone
   - Use emphasis (bold, italics) for key insights
   - Keep the emotional texture intact

4. **Write the Entry**
   - Add the entry in the appropriate chronological location
   - If a new year, add the year heading (## YYYY)
   - Ensure proper spacing and formatting

- Include any links or references mentioned
- This is a space for authentic reflection, not performative writing
