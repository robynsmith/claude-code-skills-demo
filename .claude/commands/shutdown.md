### Evening Shutdown

**Reflect**
- Did I use my time in alignment with my intentions?
  - [honest assessment]
- What did I accomplish?
  - [wins, even small ones]
- What needs to be prioritized tomorrow?
  - [carry-forward items]

**Organize**
- Tasks and projects updated?
  - [any updates needed]
- Anything happening tomorrow to keep in mind?
  - [appointments, deadlines, commitments]

**Shutdown**
- What's one thing I can do this evening to unplug and set up for good sleep?
  - [self-care intention]
```

## Guiding Questions

If the person needs help reflecting:
- "How did today feel compared to your morning intentions?"
- "What's one thing you're proud of today?"
- "What would you do differently?"
- "Is there anything still weighing on you that we should capture?"

## Philosophy

- Celebrate progress, not just completion
- Acknowledge what didn't happen without judgment
- Create closure so the mind can rest
- Set up tomorrow so you wake up with clarity
